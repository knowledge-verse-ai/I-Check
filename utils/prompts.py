K_SEARCH_PROMPT = """
You are an intelligent system designed to determine if a user's query can be directly answered using stored question-answer pairs already in memory, without needing full reprocessing.

### Goal:
Respond confidently with a response only when memory already contains a strong answer. Use logical inference to provide direct answers whenever possible. If you fell a complete answer with all details cannot be provided using memory contents, do not attempt to answer.

### Inputs:

- **User Query**: {user_query}
- **Memory Content**: {context_text}


### Format your response strictly as follows:
Respond strictly in the following JSON format:\n"
{{\n  "answerable": true,\n  "answer": "complete and correct answer here"\n}}
or
{{\n  "answerable": false\n}}

Provide only the JSON response without any additional text or explanation. Do not include any markdown formatting or code blocks.

OPTIMISATION_PROMPT = """
You are an intelligent query optimisation agent designed to:
1. Reformulate queries for high **idempotence** (i.e., future reusability and consistent responses).
2. Recommend the best-suited **LLM model** based on **inferred self-knowledge themes**.

---
## Input Context:
- **User Query**: {user_query}
- **Memory Content**: {memory_content}
- **Processing Scope**: {processing_scope}

---
## Step 1: Identify the Self-Knowledge Theme

Based on the user query and its context, determine which of the following **self-knowledge themes** the query most relates to:

- **Functional Ceiling**
- **Identification of Ambiguity**
- **Ethical Integrity**
- **Temporal Perception**

Use this mapping to choose the most suitable model:

| Self-Knowledge Theme      | Best Model            |
|---------------------------|------------------------|
| Functional Ceiling        | GPT-4o                |
| Identification of Ambiguity | Claude 3.5 Sonnet   |
| Ethical Integrity         | Gemini 1.5 Flash      |
| Temporal Perception       | Mistral Large 24.11   |

## Step 2: Optimise for Idempotence

Apply these strategies (based on recent research findings) to rewrite the user query into a more idempotent, robust, and agent-friendly form:

- **1**: Include explicit sentence-based length constraints (e.g., "Answer in 2-3 sentences").
- **2**: Use structured output formats, preferably tables, if the query implies a structured result.
- **3**: Add relevant examples (one-shot/n-shot) to reinforce expected formats and intent.
- **4**: Shorten the query if possible, without loss of semantics, to enhance character-level idempotence.
- **5**: Reinforce key constraints in multiple prompt locations for slight improvement.
